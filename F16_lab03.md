* a) This project is designed to graph a function specified by the user. You can adjust the visual boundaries of the graph and zoom in or out on certain points. Any number of graphs can be graphed at once.
* b) As a user I can specify a correctly typed polynomial or sine and cosine function so that I can view the graph. <br/>
As a user I can change the bounds of the graph so that I can zoom in or out of the function or so that I can view different parts of the function. <br/>
As a user I can add as many functions as I want so that I can compare their graphs.<br/>
As a user I can resize the window to whatever size I want so that I can view the application at my preferred size and location.<br/>
* c) The software does run. It graphs the functions it can parse correctly, but it can only parse a limited number of functions. You can drag the graph to recenter it at a different locations and view different sections of the graph. You can specify a viewing window using the panel on the right, which contains resettable boundary coordinates. You can also zoom in and out of the graph using a scroll bar on the top of the window or by resetting the bounds. You can add an arbitrary number of functions to the graph.
* d) As a user I want to be able to specify any valid function so that I can view all ranges of function types. For example, parametric and polar functions.<br/>
As a user I want to be able to recenter the graph quickly at the origin so that I do not have to scroll or drag or reset the bounds to go back to the origin.<br/>
As a user I want to be able to choose which functions out of my function list are currently displayed on the graph so that I may view different combinations of graphs I am observing easily.<br/>
As a user I want to be able to specify an input value at which the function should be evaluated for so that I can determine what the value of a given function is at a certain point on the graph.<br/>
As a user I want to be able to calculate where the function crosses the x axis so that I can quickly locate the roots of a function.<br/>
As a user I want to be able perform a broader range of operations on a given function so that I can extract useful data from the graph.<br/>
* e) The README.md file exists in the repo but it contains absolutely no useful information and might as well not be there. We need to start the README from scratch. The most important things are a description of the project, relevant issues that the project has, future goals for the project, and a brief yet detailed description of the classes in the source code.
* f) The build.xmll file is very well written. The targets do need a little description, but they are self explanatory. Nothing needs to be removed. All the targets work correctly for us without need of modification. Currently there are compile, run, test, javadoc, and clean targets.
* g) There are more than enough issues for us to obtain 1000 points. The issues are clear in terms of what they expect.
* h) Add a grid to the graph: Currently there is just a black background. It would be nice if there was a grid to be able to estimate the value of functions. This goes along with having a constantly visible x and y axis that have values associated with grid lines on them.<br/>

Allow function evaluation at any point: Allow the user to specify a point at which the function should be evaluated and return to them the evaluation of the function at that point. For example, the user could ask for the evaluation of y at the x value 5, for the function y=x+4, which would return to them a value of 9.<br/>

Move the boundary panel: Make the application look smoother by moving the boundary panel to the left and containing it in a smaller space since it does not need as much space as it currently uses. This would allow the graph to occupy more space and make the application look cleaner.<br/>
